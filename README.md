# ðŸŒ± Dry Bean Classification using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify types of dry beans using a dataset of shape and geometry features. The classification is performed through various supervised machine learning models, and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and performance evaluation.

## Project members


## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the **Dry Bean Dataset**, which contains 13 features related to the shape and geometry of bean images. It includes 7 classes:
- **SEKER**
- **BARBUNYA**
- **BOMBAY**
- **CALI**
- **HOROZ**
- **SIRA**
- **DERMASON**

## Dataset Source

This project is based on a dataset from a real **Kaggle competition** on bean plant classification.  
We developed and ran our notebook on (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bean-comp-pytunisia/overview), which provided GPU/CPU resources and competition leaderboard scoring.

> **Achieving Accuracy**: 92.941%
